# Docker images

Hello everyone!

In this repo you will find multiple Docker images with the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml file.

To run every one of them, you just need to go to the folder and from there just run:

    docker compose up -d

or

    docker-compose up -d

Rememeber that the `-d` parameter refers to detached, making the container to run on the background.

If you want to run the container in an attached terminal, do not type the `-d`.

Happy learning!
